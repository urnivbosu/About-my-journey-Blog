            Born in the bustling city of Kolkata, West Bengal, my upbringing 
            was shaped by my father's career in the Indian Army and my mother's
            dedicated role as a homemaker. Constantly on the move due to my father's
            postings across various locations in India, I developed a deep sense of 
            adaptability and a thirst for knowledge. Currently, I am in my third year 
            pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering with a 
            specialization in Cyber Physical Systems at the esteemed Vellore Institute 
            of Technology in Chennai. This article delves into my passion for web 
            development and cybersecurity, highlighting my educational journey, 
            noteworthy projects, acquired skills, and notable achievements.

          <p>I received my primary and secondary education at Kendriya Vidyalaya Barrackpore
            Airforce, where I consistently demonstrated a strong academic performance. In my 
            class 10th board examinations, I secured an impressive 94.4%, and in class 12th, 
            I attained 90.8%. These achievements laid a solid foundation for my 
            pursuit of higher education and instilled in me a drive for excellence.</p>

            During my academic journey, I actively engaged in projects and coursework 
            that allowed me to explore the exciting realms of technology. One notable project
             involved the development of a Python Tkinter-based graphical user interface 
             connected to a database, showcasing my proficiency in programming and database 
             management. Additionally, I led a team to the regional level in the prestigious 
             JNNSMEE 2021 project, where we focused on managing industry resources and 
             implementing magnet-based solutions to prevent car accidents in hilly areas. 
             These experiences further ignited my passion for problem-solving and innovation.

            Driven by a desire to go deeper into the world of technology, I embarked on a 
            comprehensive Web Development course from Udemy. This course equipped me with the 
            necessary skills and knowledge to design and develop dynamic websites, broadening 
            my horizons in the realm of front-end and back-end development. Moreover, my 
            enthusiasm for cybersecurity led me to explore various aspects of this field, 
            enhancing my understanding of data privacy, network security, and ethical hacking.
